💡  I'm a passionate Web Developer skilled in building dynamic and responsive websites from scratch, tailored to meet specific client needs.
🎓  I’ve completed full-stack training in the M.E.R.N. stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and have a strong background in both front-end and back-end development.
🌱  I'm currently focused on expanding my expertise in Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) for WordPress, custom PHP solutions, and further advancing in Next.js.
💼  In my role at Roar Media, I collaborate with cross-functional teams to design, build, and maintain WordPress websites, leveraging custom themes and functionalities to optimize user experience and meet diverse client requirements.
